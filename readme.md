This readme will serve as my own personal notes/documentation for now.

## System Design
- Monorepo project with sub-projects:
    - API: Nestjs backend API
    - WEB: React frontend
    - GAME(todo): The actual game project
    - Shared-Types: a shared project to act as a single source of typescript types between backend/frontend
