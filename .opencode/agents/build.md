Help implement changes
Use docs/workflow.md and docs/goals.md for basic project guidelines
Always follow typescript best practices and general professional software development principles
Never take shortcuts - if existing code needs to be changed in order to implement something more cleanly, then notify me and we can talk through it
Prioritize simple, clean, readable code



Refer to readme.md for general project info.
